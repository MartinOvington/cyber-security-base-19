This page provides general instructions for writing and peer reviewing
essays for the courses _Introduction to Cyber security_, _Securing Software_, and
_Advanced Topics_. The two project courses have their own instructions.

##### Writing essays

Essays are worth of 5 points. You will get only 1 chance to submit an essay, so
submit only when you are ready.

To pass an essay you must return an essay and provide at least 3 peer reviews
for each essay.  Essays must be within the limits dictated by the system. If they're
not within this limit you will not be able to submit your answer. We may also
reject your answer if it's flagged too many times as spam or if it doesn't
contain deep enough discussion. Also, we may reject your peer reviews if you
haven't put genuine effort into them.

Please write the essays carefully and with thought. Other participants in the course
will review them and give you feedback.
Essays should be written individually and using your own words. Copy-pasting
from other sources is not allowed. Copy-pasting text from other sources, such as Internet, other student answers, or text generating tools, and pretending
it to be your own counts as plagiarism.
Plagiarism is not
allowed under any circumstances, and will have consequences when caught.
See [here](https://studies.helsinki.fi/instructions/article/what-cheating-and-plagiarism) for more detailed descriptions.
The courses will use automatic plagiarism detection.

If appropriate, cite used sources and
add a list of references to the end of the essay in the following format:
```rest
References:
[1] Reference 1
[2] Reference 2
...
```



What may happen is that the course deadline is passed, and you have not received enough
feedback for the essay to be accepted automatically. In that case the course staff
will check the essay.

##### On the usage of LLM

Large Language Models (LLM) are a suite of currently developing tools that can
be used in different ways. While some usages may be useful, others may clash
with the intended learning outcomes of an individual course. Therefore, the
allowed usage depends on the course, and below is listed what usage is allowed
and what is not. Not every use case is listed as some uses are not relevant for
the CSB courses. 

General LLMs, such as ChatGPT, are known to produce incorrect, misleading, or irrelevant
statements. Therefore, it is students' responsibility to verify the correctness
and the relevancy of such statements. Moreover, often a dedicated tool will
provide better results. 

If a student decides to use LLM, they need to provide a report on their usage.
The instructions for such a report are stated below.
Note that presenting generated text as your own is plagiarism.
See https://studies.helsinki.fi/instructions/article/what-cheating-and-plagiarism for additional information about plagiarism. 


During CSB courses using LLMs 

- to generate text for reports or essays is _not_ allowed.
- to polish/rewrite text is _not_ allowed.
- to spellcheck the text is allowed (grammarly is an option here). Provide a statement in the essay if a tool was use to spell check.
- to search for information or explain or summarize concepts is allowed. Note however that essay needs to be based on cited sources, and LLM is not a valid source.
- to generate code is _not_ allowed.


##### Peer reviewing essays

Once you submit an essay, you will have to provide 3 peer reviews.

<!--At the very beginning of the course there may not be enough essays in the system.
#In that case, wait  -->

Peer reviewing consists of general comments and 4 criteria which are graded on
a scale 1-5.

You should justify your grading in the general comments. Be specific, constructive, and polite.

The general explanation for the grades is as follows:

- 1: _failed_, the essay should be rejected
- 2: _passable_, the essay is still acceptable but barely
- 3: _average_, main points are presented but there are obvious ways to improve the essay
- 4: _good_, minor issues, but otherwise excellent work
- 5: _excellent_, no issues or only cosmetic issues

The more detailed criteria-specific rubric is given below.
When providing feedback take into account length limitations on essays.



| Criteria        | Grade 1  | Grade 2 | Grade 3 | Grade 4 | Grade 5 |
| --------------- | -------- |-------- |-------- |-------- |-------- |
| comprehensive   | plagiarized, unrelated, copy-paste, or otherwise inappropriate | most important points are presented, an obvious point that should have been discussed is missing | all major points are mentioned but obvious connections are not described | all major points are described but some (subtle) connections that could have been mentioned are missing | no issues or only cosmetic issues |
| on-topic        | plagiarized, unrelated, copy-paste, or otherwise inappropriate | the essay answers the asked topic but contains portions of unrelated, unjustified discussion | most of the essay stays on topic but contains some unrelated discssion | the essay stays on-topic but contains some minor, unrelated points | no issues or only cosmetic issues |
| easy to follow  | plagiarized, unrelated, copy-paste, or otherwise inappropriate | the intention of the author is understandable from the essay but the presentation leaves room for improvement| meandering sentences, not grouped properly into paragraphs | minor grammar issues but otherwise excellent | no issues or only cosmetic issues |
| well-reasoned   | plagiarized, unrelated, copy-paste, or otherwise inappropriate | the essay requires significant effort from the reader to infer the missing steps | few gaps in logic but they can be read between the lines | minor gaps in logic | no issues or only cosmetic issues |
